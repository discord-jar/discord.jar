If you want to contribute to this project, feel free to do so! Everything that needs doing can be found in
the [Issues](https://github.com/seailz/discord.jv/issues) tab,
and if an issue there has the **available** tag you are free to make a PR fixing/adding it! :)

Make sure you first check the [active PRs](https://github.com/seailz/discord.jv/pulls) and branches for the feature/bug
you're fixing/adding.
If you make a PR for an issue with the **claimed** tag, and you are not the one who claimed it, (or in other words if
there is a PR open for the issue you're looking to fix/add), then your PR will be closed.

If you've opened a PR, but it's not yet finished, please mark it as a draft PR.
Branches should be named either:
`feature/[feature]`
or
`bug/[bugfix]`
or
`other[description]`.

To contribute to the `/examples` module, please see [here](https://github.com/discord-jv/discord.jv/tree/main/examples).
`/.github` is off limits for contirubtions, please make an issue if there is an error in that folder.
